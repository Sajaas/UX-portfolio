          <p class="light flow-text ">
            <a href=''  target='_blank'>ARcade</a> is a collection of AR filters that enhance the experience of the exhibition <a href='https://www.tekniskamuseet.se/en/discover/exhibitions/play-beyond-play/'  target='_blank'>Play Beyond Play</a> at <a href='https://www.tekniskamuseet.se/en/' target='_blank'>Tekniska Museet</a>.
            <br><br>Because of the pandemic, most AR and VR experiences are off-limits because of the risk of spreading infection. The filters engage the users by allowing them to interact with the exhibition through their phones and opens up a way to connect with the museum remotely through social media.
            <br><br>My role was to facilitate meetings, customer contact, interviewing, and designing the game and visuals.
            <br>I collaborated with four other students.

            <b>Create an Augmented Reality guide to a place/person/institution.</b> I contacted Tekniska Museet and they were interested in collaborating with us.

            <b>5 filters, one theme.</b> Each team member was responsible for one concept & filter, but we decided on the theme together.

            <b>I interviewed different groups</b> that visited the exhibition. I noticed that the target audience seemed to be families with children, which was later confirmed by the customer. We also saw that many AR and VR games were closed off due to Covid.
            <br><br>
            I asked the visitors about their habits concerning gaming and museum visits, and their thoughts about filters. All of the visitors mentioned that AR and VR were very interesting and that they find those kinds of games engaging.

          <b>I developed the game in several iterations</b> and tested it with both adults and kids.
          <br><br>
            The kids were very engaged with the game. They said it was fun, wanted to know other people's scores, and jumped up and down and laughed. 
           <br><br> 
            The adults enjoyed sharing the score and competing on social media.

          <h5 class="header">Iteration 1</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            <b>Creating the basic game in Spark AR.</b> I created the characters in Photoshop Illustrator, non-pixeled so that the kids will relate to the characters more easily, while still giving a retro feeling for the adults. I created the sound in an 8-bit sound generator, enhancing the retro feeling.

              <b>Solutions:</b> Add instructions at the start of the game. Add a transparent game over scene for selfies.

          <h5 class="header">Iteration 2</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            <b>I incorporated the feedback </b>from the tests, and further developed the game logic and cleaning up the scene, like hiding the dots when they get eaten.

              <b>Solutions:</b> Change the wording in the instructions, and add the possibility to tilt or rotate the head. Only show elements relevant for that scene of the game, and hide the rest.

          <h5 class="header">Iteration 3</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            <b>To lower the cognitive load</b>, I hid elements that weren't necessary at that time of the game. This meant showing/hiding the ghosts & the character, and switching out the "score" text to an encouraging "beat my score" text at game over for selfies.
            <br><br>
            I also added both rotate head and tilt head controls, and reset the scene when restarting the game.

            <p  class="light flow-text">
              <b>Test 3 Problems:</b> Immediately after the start of the game, it's hard to catch the dots due to the position & speed. Moving the character like they wanted it to move was also a bit hard.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solutions:</b> Fix dot & ghost position & speed, and the character speed.
