                  Our challenge was to design a solution to make the traversal system more accessible and enjoyable for totally blind individuals.

          Their problem solving skills, organization and teamwork was truly inspiring.

          They have provided us with plenty of useful material that will help to create a better product in terms of accessibility
          and additionally they might have laid the groundwork to enable blind gamers to navigate in
          sandbox games, which would be an industry first.
          <br><br>

          <p class="light flow-text">
            We defined our top research goals:
           <br>How does a blind gamer play now?
           <br>How does other games implement accessibility well?
           <br>What was an accessibility design that failed in other games?

          <h5 class="header">Playtest</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            We played the game to undestand the flow, the feeling, and their user journey.

          <h5 class="header">Benchmarking</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            During one of our first meetings were assigned 3 game titles that had recieved praise for their accessibility settings.
            <br><br>
            We played these games in order to understand what was good, and what was bad.

            We discussed our benchmark findings and questions with the accessibility consultant before our interviews and surveys.

          <h5 class="header">Interviews & surveys</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            Before we could design any solutions we had to understand the main challenges that blind gamers face when they play.
            <br><br>
            We interviewed our target audience, and sent out surveys which helped us understand the challenges better.

          <ul class="browser-default flow-text">
            <li class="bullet">Interactive Map</li>
            <li class="bullet">Navigation Assistance</li>

          <p class="light flow-text">
            We discussed our ideas with the accessibility consultant before moving on to prototyping, and he approved of all the concepts. He also explanined more in detail how he would prefer the navigation assistance and map to work.

          <h6>4. PROTOTYPING & TESTING</h6>
          <p class="light flow-text">
          We created an audio prototoype which we iterated on, based on feedback from the player test sessions. 
          <br><br>
          Due to technical issues with Adobe XD prototype sharing, we had to quickly adopt our test sessions. We realized that the button keybinds didn't work well in the browser, and that the testers needed to sign in to an adobe account in order to hear the audio. This forced us to improvise, and we solved it by pretending that the players used voice control and let them tell us which buttons to press during the test session. This also gave us an opportunity to gather data regarding their prefered buttons for each interaction.
          <h5 class="header">Version 1 top insights</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            All the testers liked the interactive map, and loved the audio narration descriptions. Most could easily navigate both the menu and the environment, but we identified the key problems to fix in the next iteration:
          </p>
            <ul class="browser-default flow-text">
              <li>40% of the users had trouble with setting Home as a waypoint</li>
              <li>40% of the users had trouble understanding some audio cues</li>
              <li>40% of the users wished the list would tell you how many items are in it</li>
              <li>40% of the users wanted the map to immediately tell them their location when opened</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="header">Version 2 top insights</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            The navigation worked much better during this version. Each tester completed the scenarious significantly faster than last time. We also gained insight to some details that could be made even better:
          </p>
            <ul class="browser-default flow-text">
              <li>60% of the players struggled with finding information about resources in their current location</li>
              <li>It wasn't clear to some players that "current location" was a menu</li>
              <li>We realized that some audio cues were too much alike</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="header">Summary of tests</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            Overall, the players were engaged, excited, and positive to the prototype! The interactive map and audio narration descriptions was especially well liked, and several mentioned that they were excited to play the game in the future.
            <br><br>
            As with all players, each have specific preferences. As such, it is important that the accessibility features are customizable and optional.
