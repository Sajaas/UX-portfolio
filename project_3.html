            The sprint was inspired both by the book <b>Sprint by Jake Knapp</b> and <b>AJ&Smarts</b> Design Sprint.
            <br><br>
            The team consisted of members with almost no experience in golf. We worked remotely during this project, with Miro as our virtual whiteboard.
            <br><br>
            Overall it was exceptional teamwork with regular check-ins, and where everyone in the team trusted each other to contribute with the workload they've been assigned.
            <br><br>
            Regardless if you're a great team or not, working so intensely can put a strain on any group, which is why we started the sprint by talking about some ground rules. We also planned a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/880940/Pummel_Party/" target="_blank">Pummel Party</a> get together to blow off some steam in the middle of the week.
            <br><br>
            As the facilitator, I made sure to be prepared for every step of the design sprint, so I could answer questions and keep us in line with the schedule.

            At the beginning was the Expert Interviews. During the interview the team took notes in the style of "How Might We"-questions, which we then sorted according to patterns and interesting ideas. We dot voted on the three most relevant HMW-questions.
            <br><br>
            Next, we voted on our long term goal: <b>In 2 years, we will have more paying customers than free customers</b>.
            <br><br>
            We then wrote and voted on the "Can We"-questions that we needed to answer to fulfill the long term goal. These were turned into the Sprint Question, which we aimed to answer at the end of the sprint.

              <li class="bullet">Can we become a part of the golf experience?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="light flow-text">
            We continued with the User Journey Mapping, a way to understand how our target groups use the app today. It illuminates pain points, and helps us identify oppertunities to create a better user experience. We decided on a vital part - the beginning of using the app - and the target group - The Ambitious.
            <br><br>
            After that, it was the Lightning Demos. Together alone, we researched other apps and services to gain inspiration and other solutions to the problem. We then presented our ideas and took notes on great ideas.
            <br><br>
            The last part of the day was the 4-Part Concept Sketching. We all wrote down ideas we found interesting for the prototype, doodled during a time limit, combined ideas, and did a rough sketch of the prototype. We continued with Crazy 8's, quick 1-minute sketches, which allowed us to explore multiple solutions fast.
            <br><br>
            We finished with Solution Concepts, where everyone creates a whole solution to the problem, step by step. We waited until day 2 to present the concepts to each other.

            We started by dot voting on the Solution Concept sketches, and the Decider chose the top 3 concepts we should focus on in the app:

            <p class="light flow-text">
              Moving on, we voted on the User Test Flow. Each team member created a flow of the way we wanted the user to interact with the app. We all dot voted, but the Decider had the final vote on which User Test Flow we would use. She also picked 1 wildcard concept she wanted us to keep in mind. This concept was <b>The user decides to set a different goal for the next golf session</b>.
            <br><br>
            With the User Test Flow in mind, we created the Storyboard. It's a visualization of the User Journey, and helped us marked the most important parts of the user journey. We chose the top 3 frames:

            Prototype day! Before we started, we decided on the roles. Some would be Makers (creating the prototype in Figma), others focus on the assets, realistic text writing, or creating the interview questions. I took the role as Sticher and Realistic Text Writer.
          <br><br>
          I started everyone up by helping them get into their roles. To make sure everyone was comfortable with their roles, I also checked in with the team now and then to see if they needed unblocking.
          <br><br>
          I wanted to make sure the test users would not be thrown off by the numbers (like handicap, swing speed, carry, etc) or the wording (like challenge names, tips, etc), so I did a lot of research. It was a great success because we got comments during the test that "these are common training games" and "this is relevant information".
          <br><br>
          When I was finished with the text, I checked in with the Makers and helped them along by creating different frames. I added all the realistic texts and numbers in the already created frames. After that, I stitched the prototype together by making sure the assets matched and put the frames into one cohesive flow.

            The last day was dedicated to User Testing Interviews. During the test interviews, the team took notes on any feelings, hesitation, reactions, and comments that would be useful to create a better prototype. We gained great insights into our assumptions and the solutions we used in the prototype.
            <br><br>
            We had 5 testers, in the age range of 19-32, both male and female. They all fit the target audience description for The Ambitious.
            <br><br>
            After the tests, we could sort the comments and insights into three feelings: positive, negative, & neutral. We were happy to gain confirmation that all the testers were positive about the experience of challenges in the app.
            <br><br>
            We could also discard the idea to plan the users next golf session since all of the test subjects wanted to see how they felt on the day of the training.

              The Documenter wrote the extensive Sprint Report. I structured it, proofread, and added any relevant information the Documenter might have missed. We presented the customer with 26 pages of insights and solutions.

              After the sprint week we got together and exchanged honest feedback, both positive and costructive.
              <br><br>
              For my part, the constructive feedback I got was that I need to take breaks. I was apparently very good at giving the team breaks, but I stayed and caught up on reading the schedule to prepare for the next task. This left me very tired in the middle of day 4 when I was listening in on the user test interviews. I will bring this insight with me to the next project so that I can keep the same energy level during the whole week.
              <br><br>
              I was humbled and delighted to hear the positive feedback. It made me feel so happy that my teammates felt comfortable and safe with me as the facilitator! And I was extremely happy with having them in the team, since they all complemented each other so well, and had different strengths during the work. We had loads of fun, all while being productive!
