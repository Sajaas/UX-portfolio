            The Brief
          </h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            Create a solution to convert non-paying customers into paying customers, while exploring the potential for gamification in the app.
          </p>
          <h5 class="header">
            Target Group
          </h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            Already existing customers. During the sprint preparation, we decided to focus on <i>"The Ambitious"</i> since they would be most inclined to be attracted to the gamification of the app because of their competitive nature.
          </p>
          <h5 class="header">Customer meeting</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            To create a valuable prototype we first needed to understand how the current product works. We had a meeting with WatchItGolf and prepared the Value Proposition Canvas, as well as the Current Customer Journey.
            <br><br>
            Since the customers had many ideas, we also had to scale the scope down and define the MVP and target audience of this sprint.

        <h5 class="header">Expert Interview & How Might We-questions</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            During the Expert Interview, the team took notes in the style of HMW-questions, which we then sorted according to patterns and interesting ideas. We dot voted on the three most relevant HMW-questions.
          </p>
          <h5 class="header">Voting on the Long Term Goal</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            <i>"In 2 years, we will have more paying customers than free customers"</i>.
          </p>
          <h5 class="header">Sprint Questions</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            We then wrote and voted on "Can We"-questions that we needed to answer to fulfill the long term goal. These were turned into the Sprint Question, which we aimed to answer at the end of the sprint.
            <br>
            <br><i>"Can we make people pay if they already have the free version?"</i>
            <br><i>"Can we use gamification to gain paying customers?"</i>
            <br><i>"Can we become a part of the golf experience?"</i>
          </p>
          <h5 class="header">Mapping</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            We continued with the User Journey Mapping, a way to understand how our target groups use the app today and help us decide what vital part of the app we should focus on. It illuminates pain points and helps us identify opportunities to create a better user experience.
          </p>
          <h5 class="header">Lightning Demos</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
           Together Alone, we researched other apps and services to gain inspiration and other approaches to the problem. We then presented the demos to each other and took notes on great ideas.
          </p>
          <h5 class="header">4-Part Concept Sketching</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            The last part of the day was the 4-Part Concept Sketching. We wrote down ideas we found interesting for the prototype, doodled during a time limit, combined ideas, and did a rough sketch of the prototype. We continued with Crazy 8's, quick 1-minute sketches, which allowed us to explore multiple solutions fast.
            <br><br>
            We finished with Solution Concepts, where everyone creates a whole solution to the problem, step by step. We waited until day 2 to present the concepts to each other.

            We started by dot voting on the Solution Concept sketches, and the Decider chose the top 3 concepts we should focus on in the app.

          <h5 class="header">User Test Flow</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            Moving on, each team member created a flow of the way we wanted the user to interact with the app. We all dot voted, but the Decider had the final vote on which User Test Flow we would use. She also picked 1 Wildcard Concept she wanted us to keep in mind.
          </p>
          <h5 class="header">Storyboard</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
          With the User Test Flow & Wildcard in mind, we created the Storyboard. It's a visualization of the User Journey, and it helped us find the most important parts of the users' interaction with the app. We chose the top 3 frames to focus on.

            <h5 class="header">Prototyping & Preparing</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            We decided on the roles - some would create the prototype in Figma, others would focus on the assets, realistic text writing, or creating the interview questions.
            <br><br>
            I started everyone up by helping them get into their roles. I also checked in with them now and then to encourage them, and to see if they needed unblocking.
          </p>
          <h5 class="header">Realistic Text Writer</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            I did a lot of research to make sure the test users would not be thrown off by the weird numbers (like handicap, swing speed, carry, etc) or wording (like challenge names, tips, etc). During the test, we got comments that it was very relevant information.
          </p>
          <h5 class="header">Stitcher</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
          When I was finished with the text, I checked in with the prototypers and helped them along by creating frames. I added all the realistic texts and numbers in the already created frames. After that, I stitched the prototype together by making sure the assets matched and put the frames into one cohesive flow.

            During the test interviews, the team took notes on any feelings, hesitation, reactions, and comments that would be useful to create a better prototype.
            <br><br>
            We had 5 testers, in the age range of 19-32, both male and female. They all fit the target audience description.

          <h5 class="header">Discarding</h5>
