          <p class="light flow-text black-text">
            <a href='https://www.getdreams.com/en/'  target='_blank'>Dreams</a> is an app that teaches about savings and economics for young adults that are intimidated by economics.
            <br><br>It removes the pain of economics by removing the fear factor, simplifying the information, and giving helpful suggestions.
            <br><br>My role was to manage the project (customer contact, present, time manage, report write, budget), interview, prototype, and design gamification and visuals.
            <br>I collaborated with four other students.

          <p class="light flow-text">
            We made sure to understand the brief before we started researching. To do this, created both a scope document and a Business Model Canvas. We also asked the customer lots of questions to gain insights on what was important to them, and what insights they already had acquired.
            <br><br>
            We had 2 creative pitches for the customer during the project, which made sure we could adapt to their needs.
            <br><br>

            During the research phase, we split into smaller teams, to divide & conquer the different parts of the research and streamline our way of working.

          <h5 class="header orange-text text-darken-2">Survey</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            Quantitative research, where we asked roughly 50 people about their feelings and habits towards private finances & learning about economics. We based our interview questions on the insights & assumptions we gained from the survey.
          </p>

          <h5 class="header orange-text text-darken-2">Interviews & Empathizing</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            Qualitative research, where we interviewed 4 people in the target audience. From this, we validated or discarded assumptions.
          </p>

          <h5 class="header orange-text text-darken-2">Customer-Provided Feedback</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            Feedback Dreams already had collected regarding their current Dreams Academy. 
            <br><br>
            <i>Note: No insights from Dreams are presented in this case study, only our research & insights.</i>
          </p>

          <h5 class="header orange-text text-darken-2">Behavioral Science</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            We dipped our toes in behavioral economics to further gain insights into our customer Dreams' needs and values. 
          </p>

          <h5 class="header orange-text text-darken-2">Gamification</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            We aimed to create a learning loop, with feedback that drives learning and skill-building and used the books <i>Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</i> by Nir Eyal, and <i>Game Thinking</i> by Amy Jo Kim.
            <br><br>
            We wanted to create internal triggers and intrinsic motivation to complete the courses and tasks. Our concepts are designed to relieve the pain associated with economics since it is a core motivation in human nature to avoid pain points.
          </p>  

          <h5 class="header orange-text text-darken-2">Competitor Analysis</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            While there are many competitors to Dreams, we identified the top two threats. We aimed to create a solution that would compete with those existing companies.

          <p class="light flow-text">
            In 2 years... Dreams is the #1 platform for saving, financial tips & tricks, & learning financial fundamentals.
            <br><br>
            Can we make the app more engaging for the users?
            <br><br>
            Can we create fun and interactive education through gamification for our users?
            <br><br>
            Can we get the users to invest/save in the long term?
            <br><br>
          </p>
          <h5 class="header orange-text text-darken-2">Lightning Demos, & 4-Part-Sketching</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            Since we had already researched competitors, we focused on the most interesting parts of the competitors products and performed lightning demos.
            <br><br>After that, we created quick concept sketches in several steps, which ended with a concept gallery that we heatmap dot voted on.
          </p>

          <h5 class="header orange-text text-darken-2">Mapping, Storyboard, & User Test Flows</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            We decided on the main focus of the user map and created a storyboard and user test flow. This, together with the top-voted concept sketches, was the base of the first iteration of the prototype.
          </p>

          <h5 class="header orange-text text-darken-2">Lo-Fi Prototyping</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            I was in charge of the prototype. Because of the Pandemic, we had to test the concepts online through video meetings. This forced us to create a slightly more complicated low-fi prototype than we would've liked, such as making it clickable and adding a bit more color and illustrations.

          <p class="light flow-text">
            During the first test, we had 5 users. Neither test user was a current Dreams Customer, but they fit the target audience for potential new customers. 
          </p>
          <h5 class="header orange-text text-darken-2">Remote testing</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            Since we couldn't be in the same room as the users, where we could change slides for them to illustrate clicking on buttons, we had to make the prototype clickable & understandable through online meetings. This forced us to incorporate mid-fi or even hi-fi elements, which removed some of the profits gained from lo-fi prototypes. 
          </p>
          <h5 class="header orange-text text-darken-2">Results</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            We gained great insights into our concepts and could see what we needed to work on for the next iteration. We could sort the comments and insights into trends (which needed to be confirmed by a majority of the test users).
            <br><br>
            We also started to get insights into what did <i>not</i> work and adapted those concepts to the feedback to further test it in the second iteration.

          <p class="light flow-text">
            To kick off the Iteration Sprint our facilitator used <a href="https://toolbox.hyperisland.com/feedback-hats" target="_blank">Six Thinking Hats</a> to reflect on the initial sprint, and the future of the project.
          </p>
          <h5 class="header orange-text text-darken-2">Dividing the Work</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            I created a schedule for the things that we needed to deliver and attend to. After the exercise, the group divided the work. 
          </p>
          <h5 class="header orange-text text-darken-2">Hi-Fi Prototype</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            I continued to work on the prototype, incorporating solutions from the feedback and insights we gained from the user testing. I was very excited to use Figma's beta for <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061175334-Create-interactive-components-with-variants" target="_blank">interactive components & variants</a>!
          </p>

          <h5 class="header orange-text text-darken-2">User Testing 2 - Hi-fi</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            During the second testing, we had 3 users. Same as before: no test user was a current Dreams Customer, but they fit the target audience for potential new customers.
            <br><br>
            We gained even more positive feedback during the second round of testing, further validating our concept solutions. 
            <br><br>
            We also gained enough feedback and insights to be able to say that we had a few concepts that we could not validate or recommend, and made sure to communicate this to the customer in both the presentation and the report.
          </p>
          
          <h5 class="header orange-text text-darken-2">Presentation & Report</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            I created the structure of the report, and then the team split up the work to write the report, where each one picked the subject they knew best. After everyone had added their parts, I proofread and edited the report.
            <br><br>
            I also created the final budget, and was happy to report that we only spent 60% of the budget!
            <br><br>
            While I worked on the budget and report, my team started creating the presentation that I would use when I presented the final result to the client.

              <h6>Customer Feedback</h6>
              <p class="light flow-text">
                After the presentation, we got feedback from three Dreams employees, and they all responded positively to our project. Some things they said that they liked were: 
              </p>
                <ul class="browser-default light flow-text">
                  <li class="bullet">That we showed what works, and what didn't work</li>
                  <li class="bullet">That we selected test users with the target audience in mind</li>
                  <li class="bullet">That we tested both iterations to validate our concepts</li>
                  <li class="bullet">That we focused on language UX writing</li>
                  <li class="bullet">The way we connected the Academy feature to the existing Dreams app</li>
                  <li class="bullet">That we personalized the Academy experience to the user</li>
                  <li class="bullet">That we made the learning interactive and trackable</li>
                  <li class="bullet">Our use of visual aids like illustrations</li>
                  <li class="bullet">That we were creative with our concepts</li>
                  <li class="bullet">That we had immediate feedback after per example quizzes</li>
                  <li class="bullet">That the game idea was neat</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="light flow-text">
                The constructive feedback we got from the customer was that they'd like more details about the defined research objectives and that we could have spent a bit more time showing the concepts during the presentation.
                <br><br>
                We had planned to show the prototype and concepts in a live walkthrough, in their preferred way, so we were happy to hear the request to see more of the concepts! That also started a conversation about our recommendations and it was great to be able to discuss with them.
                <br><br>
                We were overwhelmed and proud to get such amazing feedback from the customer.

              <p class="light flow-text">
                During our team retrospective, we all agreed that we would have liked to have a second round of interviews so that we could iterate on the questions and gained even more information and insights.
                <br><br>
                We also reflected on how complicated it was to create a remotely-testable lo-fi prototype, and that it would be great with a second iteration to validate the concepts even further. 
                <br><br>
                Lastly, we discussed the constructive feedback we got from the customer about even more clearly defined research objectives, and spend more time on the concepts during the presentation. It's something we will bring with us to the next project!
