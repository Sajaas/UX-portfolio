          <h6>IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEMS</h6>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            Upon joining the project, I focused on improving the onboarding and tutorial to better fit the target audience, some of whom were not familiar with the Cities: Skylines franchise. 
            Through initial review and user testing, I identified various issues including: 
          </p>
          <ul class="browser-default flow-text">
            <li class="bullet">Overwhelming instructions</li>
            <li class="bullet">Long tutorial duration</li>
            <li class="bullet">Multiple prompts at once</li>
            <li class="bullet">Difficulty remembering controls</li>
            <li class="bullet">Intrusive UI screens that followed the player's face</li>
            <li class="bullet">Missed vibrations & indications</li>
            <li class="bullet">Lack of understanding of basic game mechanics</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            These issues resulted in a significant percentage (40%) of players being unable to complete the tutorial. 
            <!-- To address these issues, I made design changes such as switching from radio buttons to checkboxes, prototyped a new tutorial flow and conducted further user testing to iteratively improve the tutorial experience. -->

          <h6>PROTOTYPING, TESTING & ITERATING</h6>   
          <p class="light flow-text">
            To improve the player experience I focused on prototyping and testing new tutorial instructions and a controller cheat sheet, as well as identifying quick fixes such as changing the city border color and allowing players to receive a full refund during the tutorial. 
            <br><br>
            In addition, we implemented stationary screens which were found to be more effective in helping players understand and retain information, as well as a Player Guide to provide players with ongoing support and information throughout the game.
            <br><br>
            While the tutorial is now quicker and all players were able to complete it, players still struggled with remembering controls and button placements. Further updates and solutions will be implemented in the future to continue improving the player experience.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- <div class="col s12 m12 l12" id="">

        <div class="col s12 m12 l6">
          <h6>3. ITERATING</h6>   
          <p class="light flow-text">
            While testing the new instructions and GIFs to show controller buttons, I noticed that while this was effective in some areas, it was not sufficient in helping players remember controls and button placements. 
            <br><br>
            When testing stationary screens I noticed that players tended to read and grasp the instructions much more efficiantly than before. We also added a Player Guide to provide players with additional support and information throughout the game. 
            <br><br>
            While the tutorial is much quicker and 100% of the players got through the tutorial quicker and without getting stuck, players still struggled with remembering controls and button placements. Further updates and solutions are being tested and will be implemented in the future.
          </p>

          <h5 class="header">1: New instructions & button GIFs</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            The tested, new instructions were in! The test was much quicker, no players got stuck, and they were generally less confused. 
            <br><br>
            We also added GIFS with pictures of the controllers, highlighting the relevant buttons.
            <br><br>
            While this was a cost-effective and fast way to show button locations, it was ultimately not enough.
          </p>
          <ul class="browser-default flow-text">
            <li class="bullet">Players didn't remember controls & buttons</li>
            <li class="bullet">GIFs moved too fast</li>
            <li class="bullet">The intrusive screen still annoyed players</li>
          </ul>
          <h5 class="header">2: Stationary screens</h5>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            During the past two tests, I noticed players trying to look past the instruction screens. It seems like it was interfering with the learning.
            <br><br>
            We fixed the screens and implemented a Player Guide which would support players with information later in the game.
            <br><br>
            The result of the stationary screens was better than expected! 
          </p>
          <ul class="browser-default flow-text">
            <li class="bullet">Players noticed indications and vibrations</li>
            <li class="bullet">Tutorial was quicker</li>
            <li class="bullet">Players read the instructions more</li>
            <li class="bullet">Tutorial felt short</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="light flow-text">
            But, players still had issues with knowing button placement and remembering controls.
            <br><br>
            When playing VR games it's a hassle to look at the controls, since you need to remove the headset to do so. 
            <br><br>
            Players also forgot which buttons had which action, since they focused on trying to remember button placements.

                  <h6>1. DEFINING THE PROBLEM</h6>
                  <h5>The tutorial & target audience</h5>
                  <p class="light flow-text">
                    I joined Fast Travel Games as their first UX Designer after the skeleton of the tutorial had been created.
                    <br><br>
                    I quickly noticed that it needed some love to fit the target audiences since not all would be familiar with the Cities: Skylines franchise.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Initial review</h5>
                  <p class="light flow-text">
                    I found some low-hanging fruit that would help players.
                    <br><br>
                    For example, switching from radio buttons to checkboxes when players can check several options.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Initial test</h5>
                  <p class="light flow-text">
                    To validate the need for an update, and identify the main pain points, I ran an initial tutorial test on Cities: VR. 
                    <br><br>
                    40% of the players couldn't even finish the tutorial! Other insights included:

                  <h6>2. PROTOTYPING & QUICK FIXES</h6>   
                  <p class="light flow-text">
                    While some fixes could only be tested after a rough implementation, I could test and iterate on the instructions.

                  <h5 class="header">Instructions</h5>
                  <p class="light flow-text">
                    I created and iterated on the tutorial texts in Figma, testing each iteration on the target audience through 1-on-1 interviews online.

                  <h5 class="header">Controller Cheat Sheet</h5>
                  <p class="light flow-text">
                    Cities: VR is a very complex game, and not everything is being taught at the tutorial. 
                    <br><br>
                    Since players also got overwhelmed by the amount of information and controls, I suggested we add a controller cheat sheet to the game.
                    <br><br>
                    While testing the instructions, I also tested my wireframe of the controls.
                  </p>
                  <h5 class="header">Quick fixes</h5>
                  <p class="light flow-text">
                    I had identified some issues which could be easily fixed by the developers. Some examples are:
                  </p>
                  <ul class="browser-default flow-text">
                    <li class="bullet"> <b>The city border looks like water</b> while the player is in the water-view. 
                      Just by changing the color, no players thought it was water in future tests.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li class="bullet"> <b>Players could run out of money</b> and get stuck in the tutorial. 
                      We changed the bulldozing so players could get a full refund during the tutorial. 
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  </p>
                  <h5 class="header">1: New instructions & button GIFs</h5>
                  <p class="light flow-text">
                    The tested, new instructions were in! The test was much quicker, no players got stuck, and they were generally less confused. 
                    <br><br>
                    We also added GIFS with pictures of the controllers, highlighting the relevant buttons.
                    <br><br>
                    While this was a cost-effective and fast way to show button locations, it was ultimately not enough.
                  </p>
                  <ul class="browser-default flow-text">
                    <li class="bullet">Players didn't remember controls & buttons</li>
                    <li class="bullet">GIFs moved too fast</li>
                    <li class="bullet">The intrusive screen still annoyed players</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h5 class="header">2: Stationary screens</h5>
                  <p class="light flow-text">
                    During the past two tests, I noticed players trying to look past the instruction screens. It seems like it was interfering with the learning.
                    <br><br>
                    We fixed the screens and implemented a Player Guide which would support players with information later in the game.
                    <br><br>
                    The result of the stationary screens was better than expected! 
                  </p>
                  <ul class="browser-default flow-text">
                    <li class="bullet">Players noticed indications and vibrations</li>
                    <li class="bullet">Tutorial was quicker</li>
                    <li class="bullet">Players read the instructions more</li>
                    <li class="bullet">Tutorial felt short</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="light flow-text">
                    But, players still had issues with knowing button placement and remembering controls.
                    <br><br>
                    When playing VR games it's a hassle to look at the controls, since you need to remove the headset to do so. 
                    <br><br>
                    Players also forgot which buttons had which action, since they focused on trying to remember button placements.
